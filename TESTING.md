# Testing Plan for Angular and NestJS Application

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Project Description

This project is a full-stack application built using the NX monorepo architecture, featuring an Angular frontend and a NestJS backend. The application is wrapped within Electron to provide a desktop application experience. The backend handles most of the business logic, while the frontend is responsible for the user interface and interactions.

### 1.2 Objective of the Testing Plan

The objective of this testing plan is to outline a comprehensive strategy to fully test the entire application. The testing will cover all aspects of the application, including unit tests, integration tests, end-to-end (E2E) tests, and user interface tests. This plan aims to ensure the application is robust, reliable, and ready for deployment, while also demonstrating professional testing practices to potential employers.

## 2. Testing Objectives

- **Ensure Functional Correctness:** Verify that all components of the application function as intended.
- **Achieve High Test Coverage:** Attain substantial code coverage for both backend and frontend codebases.
- **Identify and Fix Defects:** Detect any bugs or issues in the application and resolve them promptly.
- **Validate Integration Points:** Ensure seamless interaction between frontend and backend components.
- **Assess Performance and Stability:** Evaluate the application's performance under various conditions.
- **Ensure Security Compliance:** Confirm that the application meets security best practices.

## 3. Scope of Testing

### 3.1 Modules to be Tested

- **Backend (NestJS):**

  - REST APIs
  - Business logic layers
  - Database interactions
  - Authentication and authorization mechanisms

- **Frontend (Angular):**

  - UI components and templates
  - Services and state management
  - Form validations and user input handling
  - Routing and navigation

- **Shared Libraries:**

  - Reusable components and services
  - Utility functions and helpers
  - Custom validators and directives

- **Electron Integration:**
  - Application packaging and distribution
  - Native integrations and APIs

### 3.2 Features to be Tested

- Core functionalities of the application
- User interactions and UI workflows
- Data retrieval and manipulation
- Error handling and edge cases
- Security features (e.g., input sanitization, authentication)

### 3.3 Features Not to be Tested

- Third-party libraries and modules (beyond verifying integration)
- Deprecated or legacy features (if any)

---

## 4. Testing Strategy

### 4.1 Testing Methodologies

- **Unit Testing:**

  - Test individual units/components in isolation.
  - Tools: Jest for Angular and Vitest for NestJS

- **Integration Testing:**

  - Test the interactions between integrated units/components.
  - Tools: Vitest for NestJS for OS-level integration testing

- **End-to-End (E2E) Testing:**

  - Test the application flow from start to finish in a real-world scenario.
  - Tools: Playwright (with expremental Electron support), Vitest with Supertest for API testing

- **User Interface Testing:**

  - Validate UI components render correctly and handle user interactions.
  - Tools: Jasmine (for Angular), Storybook (for component testing)

- **Performance Testing:**

  (Need further discussion on the performance testing tools and methodologies)

  - Assess the application's responsiveness and stability under load.
  - Tools: k6, Artillery

- **Security Testing:**
  - Identify vulnerabilities and ensure security measures are effective.
  - Tools: OWASP ZAP, npm audit

### 4.2 Tools and Frameworks

- **Testing Frameworks:**

  - Jest, Vitest (Unit and integration tests)
  - Playwright (E2E tests with Electron support)
  - Jasmine (Angular unit tests)

- **Mocking and Stubbing:**

  - Supertest (HTTP mocking in Node.js)
  - Viest Mock Functions

- **Continuous Integration:**

  (Need further discussion on the CI/CD tools and pipelines)

  - GitHub Actions / GitLab CI for automated testing pipelines

## 5. Testing Schedule

### Preparation and Backend Testing

- [x] Set up testing environments and tools.
- [x] Review existing backend test coverage.
- [x] Focus on the most critical and complex business logic components.
- [x] Develop backend integration tests using Vitest to review OS-level interaction.
- [x] Proivde a test coverage for the backend codebase available for SonarCloud.
- Write additional backend unit tests to achieve at least 80% code coverage.
- Test API endpoints using SuperTest, including edge cases and error conditions.

### Frontend Unit Testing

- [x] Configure testing tools for Angular (Jasmine).
- Identify key UI components and services to test.
- Write unit tests for UI components, focusing on:
  - Component rendering
  - Input validation
  - Event handling
- Write unit tests for services and state management logic.
- Ensure at least 70% code coverage on the frontend.

### E2E Testing and Electron Integration

- Set up Playwright for E2E testing with Electron support.
- Define critical user journeys to test.
- Write E2E tests covering:
  - User authentication flows
  - Data entry and submission
  - Navigation and routing
- Execute E2E tests and document results.
- Identify and fix any defects found during testing.

### Performance, Security Testing, and Final Review

- Conduct performance testing using k6 or Artillery.
- Analyze performance bottlenecks and optimize code.
- Perform security testing with OWASP ZAP.
- Review code for security vulnerabilities.
- Prepare test reports and documentation.
- Ensure all tests are integrated into the CI pipeline.
- Final review and cleanup.
- Reflect on testing outcomes and prepare a summary presentation.
