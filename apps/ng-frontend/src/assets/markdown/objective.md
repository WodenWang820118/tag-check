# Objective

The objective of this project is to let users create and manage their own Google Tag Manager (GTM) tag audit projects. The user can create a project, add tags to it, and then run an audit on the tags. The audit will check if the tags are used in the correct context and if they are used at all. The user can then review the audit results and make changes to the tags if necessary.

## Google Tag Manager

Google Tag Manager is a tag management system that allows users to manage and deploy tags on their websites without having to modify the code. Tags are snippets of code that are used to collect data from the website and send it to third-party services like Google Analytics, Facebook Pixel, etc.

## Audit

The audit will check if the tags are used in the correct context and if they are used at all. For example, if a tag is supposed to fire on a specific page, the audit will check if the tag is firing on that page. If a tag is not firing as expected, the report will mark it as failed and provide details on why it failed.

Failure reasons can include:

- The tag is not firing at all
- The tag is firing, but with incorrect parameters
