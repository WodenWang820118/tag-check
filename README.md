# TagCheck
## Overview
This desktop application automates the GTM (Google Tag Manager) container review process and the production analytics deployment validation. It streamlines the quality assurance process by providing:

GTM Container Review: The tool can load the GTM preview mode according to the workspace, run the Chrome recorder, and generate a report on dataLayer correctness. Users can review the tag configuration through the GTM preview mode as well.
Production Analytics Validation: It validates analytics on the production website, ensuring dataLayer accuracy.
Designed for QA, development, and analytics teams, this free standalone tool leverages Angular 17, Nest.js, and Electron.

Upcoming features include enhanced UI/UX, request interception, report consolidation, and improved project import/export capabilities.
