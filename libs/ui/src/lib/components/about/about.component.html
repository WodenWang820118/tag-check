    Tag Build is an innovative tool designed specifically for digital marketers
    and SEO professionals. It streamlines the process of generating JSON files
    for Google Tag Manager (GTM), following GA4's recommended event structure to
    ensure optimal tracking implementation.

    While Google Tag Manager offers basic functionality for implementing GA4
    events, the rapidly evolving nature of business and marketing requirements
    often necessitates frequent updates and validation. Tag Build addresses
    these challenges by providing a more efficient and maintainable solution.

      Why Tag Build?
    </h1>
    <div class="about__section-content" i18n="@@about.section.why.content">
      Traditional implementation methods using Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
      servers can synchronize Google Sheets with GTM effectively. However, many
      marketing agencies lack access to GCP resources, creating a need for a
      more accessible solution. Tag Build bridges this gap by providing a
      standalone tool that doesn't require complex infrastructure.
